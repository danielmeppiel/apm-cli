# Changelog

## [0.1.6] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Fixed missing Agent Primitives in CI-built binaries**
  - Added `include-hidden-files: true` to GitHub Actions upload-artifact@v4
  - GitHub Actions v4.4+ excludes hidden files by default, causing `.apm` directories to be lost
  - This was causing "Template file not found" errors in released binaries
  - Added verification steps to CI to catch similar issues in the future
- **Enhanced E2E tests to verify template bundling**
  - Added dedicated test for `apm init` command and `.apm` directory creation
  - E2E tests now catch template bundling failures during CI

### Technical Details
- Root cause: `upload-artifact@v4` behavior change excluding hidden files
- Impact: All released binaries from v0.1.0 to v0.1.5 missing Agent Primitives
- Solution: Explicit `include-hidden-files: true` configuration

## [0.1.5] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **Critical CI/CD artifact merge issue** - Fixed GitHub Actions workflow where `merge-multiple: true` was causing artifact conflicts and dropping hidden `.apm` directories

## [0.1.4] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **Critical PyInstaller template bundling fix** - Fixed PyInstaller spec file to properly bundle hidden `.apm` directories containing Agent Primitives (chatmodes, instructions, context, specs)

## [0.1.3] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **Critical PyInstaller template bundling fix** - Fixed PyInstaller spec file to properly bundle hidden `.apm` directories containing Agent Primitives (chatmodes, instructions, context, specs)

## [0.1.2] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **CI/CD Build Environment**: Standardized CI/CD build process to use uv like local development
  - Ensures consistent dependency resolution between local and CI builds
  - Activates virtual environment during binary build process
  - Fixes potential environment-related build discrepancies

### Technical Details
- Updated GitHub Actions workflow to use uv for dependency management in build job
- Added virtual environment activation step in CI/CD binary build process
- This ensures CI/CD builds match local development environment exactly

## [0.1.1] - 2025-08-27

### Fixed
- **Critical binary installation fix** - Fixed PyInstaller `--onedir` mode binary distribution where only the main executable was being installed, leaving behind the essential `_internal/` directory containing the Python runtime
- **Template bundling fix** - Fixed PyInstaller spec to properly bundle template files including hidden `.apm` directories that were being ignored during packaging
- **Compilation module fix** - Added missing `apm_cli.compilation` modules to PyInstaller's `hiddenimports` to resolve "attempted relative import with no known parent package" errors

### Improved
- **Enhanced install script** - Updated install script to properly handle PyInstaller `--onedir` mode by copying the entire bundle directory to `/usr/local/lib/apm/` and creating a symlink in `/usr/local/bin/apm`

## [0.1.0] - 2025-08-27

### Changed
- **Complete rebranding from AWD to APM** - Changed from "Agentic Workflow Definitions (AWD)" to "Agent Primitives Manager (APM)"
- **New positioning** - APM is now positioned as "the package manager for AI-Native Development"
