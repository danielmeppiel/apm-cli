- This project uses uv to manage Python environments and dependencies.
- To run it, you need to activate the virtual environment created by uv, which is called venv.
- Unit tests are run with pytest.
- The solution must meet the functionality as explained in the [README.md](README.md) file.
- The general high-level basis to the solution is depicted in [APPROACH.md](../../APPROACH.md). 
- When developing functionality, we need to respect our own [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md) file.
The architectural decisions and basis for the project in that document are only the inspiring foundation. It can and should always be challenged when needed and is not meant as the only truth, but a very useful context and grounding research.
- The project is meant for the Open Source community and should be open to contributions and follow the standards of the community.
- The project is meant to be used by developers and should be easy to use, with a focus on developer experience.
