# Architecture Guidelines

## System Design Principles

### Modularity
- Design loosely coupled, highly cohesive modules
- Use clear interfaces between components
- Implement proper dependency injection
- Follow single responsibility principle

### Scalability
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- Use stateless services where possible
- Implement proper caching strategies
- Consider eventual consistency for distributed systems

### Security
- Apply defense in depth principles
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Use secure communication protocols
- Follow principle of least privilege
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

### Performance
- Optimize critical paths identified through profiling
- Use appropriate data structures and algorithms
- Implement proper monitoring and alerting
- Consider asynchronous processing for long-running tasks

### Maintainability
- Write self-documenting code with clear naming
- Implement comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Use consistent coding standards across the project
- Maintain up-to-date documentation and architectural decision records
