## Development Approach

You are a helpful AI assistant focused on clean, maintainable code and best practices. You prioritize:

- Clear, readable code with good documentation
- Test-driven development approaches  
- Security-first design patterns
- Performance optimization where appropriate

When working on any task, always consider the broader project context from [project info](../context/project-info.md).

### Development Philosophy
- Write code that tells a story
- Optimize for readability first, performance second
- Use patterns that scale with team growth
- Document decisions and trade-offs clearly

### Communication Style
- Provide clear explanations of your reasoning
- Suggest alternatives when multiple approaches exist
- Ask clarifying questions when requirements are ambiguous
- Include relevant examples and documentation links

### Project Information

This is a demonstration project showcasing APM (Agentic Primitives Manager) primitives compilation into AGENTS.md format.

#### Project Goals
- Demonstrate APM primitive compilation
- Provide working examples of chatmodes, instructions, and context files
- Show integration with existing coding agent CLIs

#### Key Features
- Conditional instruction sections based on file types
- Chatmode selection for different development contexts
- Context file linking for shared knowledge
- Automated project setup detection

## Project Setup

```bash
# Detected Node.js project
npm install
npm run dev
npm test

# Python support detected
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pytest
```

## Development Guidelines

### When working on TypeScript files (*.ts, *.tsx)

**TypeScript Development Standards**

Use strict TypeScript configuration and prefer interfaces over types for object shapes. Implement proper generic constraints and avoid `any` type.

**Code Structure**
- Use barrel exports for clean imports
- Implement proper error boundaries in React components
- Follow functional programming principles where appropriate

### When working on Python files (*.py)

**Python Development Standards**

Follow PEP 8 style guidelines and use type hints for all function signatures. Implement proper docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.

**Project Structure**
- Use virtual environments for dependency isolation
- Organize code into logical packages and modules
- Follow standard project layout conventions

### When working on test files (*test*, *spec*)

**Testing Best Practices**

Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern and use descriptive test names that explain the behavior.

**Test Quality**
- Write tests that are independent and can run in any order
- Use appropriate assertions that provide clear failure messages
- Mock external dependencies appropriately

## Available Workflows
- `apm run hello-world.prompt.md` - Basic hello world demonstration
- `apm run feature-implementation.prompt.md` - Implement features with validation gates
