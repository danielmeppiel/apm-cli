# Hello Feature Specification

## Overview
This specification defines the requirements for implementing a basic "Hello" feature that demonstrates APM primitives integration and serves as a foundation for more complex features.

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. **User Greeting**: The system must accept a user's name and provide a personalized greeting
2. **Parameter Validation**: Input parameters must be validated and sanitized
3. **Error Handling**: The system must gracefully handle invalid inputs
4. **Logging**: All interactions must be logged for debugging purposes

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. **Performance**: Response time must be under 100ms
2. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime requirement
3. **Scalability**: Must handle 1000 concurrent users
4. **Security**: Input validation and sanitization required

## Acceptance Criteria

### Story: User receives personalized greeting
**Given** a user provides their name
**When** they request a greeting
**Then** they receive a personalized message
**And** the interaction is logged

### Story: System handles invalid input
**Given** a user provides invalid or empty input
**When** they request a greeting
**Then** they receive an appropriate error message
**And** the error is logged for debugging

## Implementation Guidelines
- Follow the testing guidelines from [testing instructions](../instructions/testing.instructions.md)
- Implement using patterns from [architecture context](../context/architecture.context.md)
- Ensure code quality meets standards in language-specific instructions
