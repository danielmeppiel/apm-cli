# Architecture Guidelines

## System Design Principles

### Modularity and Separation of Concerns
- Design systems with clear boundaries and responsibilities
- Use interfaces to define contracts between components
- Implement dependency injection for loose coupling
- Follow the single responsibility principle

### Scalability Patterns
- Design for horizontal scaling from the start
- Use event-driven architectures for loose coupling
- Implement caching strategies at appropriate layers
- Consider database sharding and partitioning strategies

### Security Architecture
- Implement defense in depth security strategies
- Use secure by default configurations
- Apply the principle of least privilege consistently
- Regular security reviews and penetration testing

### Performance Considerations
- Optimize database queries and indexing
- Implement appropriate caching layers
- Monitor and profile application performance
- Use CDNs for static content delivery

### Documentation Standards
- Maintain up-to-date architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Document API contracts with OpenAPI/Swagger
- Create clear deployment and operational guides
- Provide troubleshooting runbooks
