# APM GitHub Action: Continuous AI Made Simple

## Strategic Vision

**Transform GitHub Actions into the universal runtime for AI workflows.** 

Instead of custom TypeScript actions for every AI task, developers write markdown prompts and let APM handle the complexity. Same workflows work locally (`apm run`) and in CI/CD seamlessly. 

## The Opportunity

### Current Reality: AI Workflows Are Hard
- **Each AI task = Custom TypeScript action** (issue labeling, code review, release notes)
- **No reusability** across teams or projects  
- **No local testing** - commit-push-wait cycles
- **Vendor lock-in** to specific LLM providers

### APM Solution: Dead Simple Universal Action
```yaml
# Before: Custom action for each AI task (hundreds of lines of TypeScript)
- uses: pelikhan/action-genai-issue-labeller@v0

# After: Universal APM action + reusable prompts (zero TypeScript)
- uses: apm-action/run@v1
  with:
    script: issue-triage
    issue_number: ${{ github.event.issue.number }}
    max_labels: 3
  env:
    GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

**The Magic**: Same `issue-triage` script works locally and in Actions thanks to APM. Write your AI script once, in plain Mardkwon, and run anywhere - both locally and in CI.

## Why This Will Succeed

### 1. APM is Already Production-Ready
- **Mature CLI** with cross-platform binaries (Linux, macOS)
- **Automated runtime management** (codex/llm installation)
- **NPM-like ecosystem** (`apm init`, `apm run`, `apm install`)
- **GitHub Models integration** (free tier) 
- **Comprehensive testing** in CI/CD

### 2. Ultra-Simple Implementation
The action is just a **thin wrapper** around APM's proven capabilities:

```typescript
// The entire action (simplified)
async function run() {
  // 1. Install APM (one command)
  await exec.exec('curl -sSL https://install.apm.sh | sh');
  
  // 2. Setup runtime automatically  
  await exec.exec('apm runtime setup codex');
  
  // 3. Run the script with parameters
  const script = core.getInput('script') || 'start';
  const params = gatherAllInputsAsParams();
  await exec.exec(`apm run ${script} ${params.join(' ')}`);
}
```

### 3. Immediate Ecosystem
- **Works with existing APM projects** (thousands of potential workflows)
- **Local development workflow** already established
- **Community adoption** through APM CLI users

## Technical Architecture

### Dead Simple Action Design
```yaml
# action.yml - Clean interface, no complex parameters
name: 'APM - AI Workflow Runner'
description: 'Run AI workflows with natural language prompts'
inputs:
  script:
    description: 'Script name from apm.yml (default: start)'
    default: 'start'
  working-directory:
    description: 'Working directory'
    default: '.'
  # All other inputs become --param key=value automatically
runs:
  using: 'node20'
  main: 'dist/index.js'
```

### Core Implementation Strategy
**Leverage APM's existing superpowers instead of reinventing:**

1. **Installation**: Use APM's proven install script
2. **Runtime Management**: Use APM's automated setup
3. **Execution**: Use APM's script runner with parameter substitution
4. **Error Handling**: Use APM's rich error reporting
5. **Output**: Stream APM's real-time output to Actions logs

## Implementation Plan: Ship Fast, Learn Fast

### Phase 1: MVP Action (1-2 weeks)
**Goal**: Working action that installs APM and runs scripts

**Week 1**: Core functionality
- [ ] Create `apm-action` repository with TypeScript setup

- [ ] Basic error handling and output streaming

**Week 2**: Polish and publish
- [ ] Add comprehensive error messages and debugging
- [ ] Create marketplace listing with clear examples
- [ ] Test end-to-end with real GitHub workflows
- [ ] Document the "Continuous AI" pattern

**Deliverable**: Published GitHub Action that works with existing APM projects

### Phase 2: Ecosystem Examples (2-3 weeks)  
**Goal**: Compelling use cases that drive adoption

**Examples to build**:
- [ ] **Issue Triage**: Auto-label issues using GitHub MCP tools
- [ ] **Code Review**: AI-powered PR analysis and comments
- [ ] **Release Notes**: Generate release notes from commit history
- [ ] **Security Scan**: AI analysis of dependency changes

## Success Metrics & Competitive Advantage

### Phase 1 Success (Month 1)
- [ ] **Action published** to GitHub Marketplace
- [ ] **5+ working examples** (issue triage, code review, release notes)
- [ ] **First 10 community adoptions** tracked via marketplace
- [ ] **Developer feedback** collected and integrated

### Phase 2 Success (Month 2-3)
- [ ] **100+ action uses** across different repositories
- [ ] **Community contributions** (new workflow examples)
- [ ] **Integration tutorials** published
- [ ] **Performance benchmarks** established

### Long-term Vision (6+ months)
- [ ] **1000+ weekly action runs** 
- [ ] **GitHub Marketplace featured** listing
- [ ] **Community ecosystem** of shared workflows
- [ ] **Enterprise adoption** case studies

### Why We'll Win

**1. Timing**: AI workflows are exploding, but tooling is fragmented
**2. Simplicity**: 10x easier than custom TypeScript actions  
**3. Ecosystem**: APM CLI already has proven adoption
**4. Portability**: Same workflows work locally and in CI/CD
**5. Community**: Open source with network effects

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks → Solutions
- **APM installation slow**: Pre-cache binaries, optimize install script
- **Action timeouts**: Implement proper timeouts and error handling  
- **Runtime compatibility**: Extensive testing across platforms
- **GitHub API limits**: Built-in rate limiting and retries

### Market Risks → Mitigations  
- **GitHub builds competing solution**: Position as complementary ecosystem
- **Low adoption**: Strong examples and developer experience
- **Developer complexity**: Keep interface dead simple, great docs

## Why This Changes Everything

**Before APM Action**: Each AI workflow requires custom TypeScript development, testing, and maintenance. Teams spend weeks building what should take minutes.

**After APM Action**: Teams write natural language prompts, test locally with `apm run`, then deploy to Actions with zero additional code.

**The Result**: AI workflows become as easy to create and share as npm packages. GitHub Actions becomes the universal runtime for Continuous AI.

This isn't just another GitHub Action - it's the infrastructure that enables the **"npm for AI workflows"** ecosystem to flourish on GitHub's platform.
